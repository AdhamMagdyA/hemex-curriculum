# Backend Development Track

This track covers server-side programming, database integration, and API development using modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Overview
This track focuses on building robust backend applications using Node.js, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced concepts like authentication, ORM, and real-world project implementation.

## Project-Based Learning

The curriculum uses a [Todo API](../../resources/projects/todo) project that evolves through each level to demonstrate:
- Basic CRUD operations (Level 1)
- Database integration (Level 2)
- Authentication (Level 3)
- Advanced patterns (Level 4)

## Track Objectives
By the end of this track, students will be able to:
- Build production-ready Node.js applications
- Implement secure authentication systems
- Work with databases using modern ORMs
- Create middleware and handle request validation
- Implement role-based access control
- Build and deploy full e-commerce solutions

## Levels
1. [Introduction to Backend Development](./1-intro)
