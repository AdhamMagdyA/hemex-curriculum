# Building Payment Integration: The Digital Wallet 💳

## Lesson Overview

Welcome to the payment integration phase! In this lesson, we'll build the payment system for our e-commerce platform. Think of it as creating a digital wallet that securely handles transactions 💳.

## For Instructors

### Lesson Objectives

Students will learn:
- Integrate Stripe payment
- Handle payment webhooks
- Manage payment states
- Implement payment security

### Teaching Strategy

- Use the "digital wallet" analogy
- Start with basic payment setup
- Add webhook handling
- Emphasize security (make students brainstorp for possible security problems)

## Part 1: Stripe Setup - The Digital Payment Gateway 🏦

### Key Steps

1. **Account Setup**
   - Create Stripe account
   - Get API keys
   - Set up webhook

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```javascript
   // .env
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```

## Part 2: Payment Service - The Digital Transaction Handler 💳

### Key Features

1. **Payment Creation**
   ```javascript
   // POST /api/payments
   - Create payment intent
   - Handle payment confirmation

   ```javascript
   // POST /api/webhooks/stripe
   - Verify signature
   - Handle events
   - Update database
   ```

2. **Event Handling**
   - Payment succeeded
   - Payment failed
   - we will not handle refunds here

## Part 4: Payment States - The Digital Transaction Flow 🔄

### Key States

**instructor note: assignment for students to create the state diagram of this payment states**

1. **Payment States**
   ```javascript
   const paymentStates = {
     PENDING: 'pending',
     SUCCEEDED: 'succeeded',
     FAILED: 'failed',
     REFUNDED: 'refunded'
   };
   ```

2. **State Transitions**
   - Handle payment success
   - Handle payment failure
   - Handle refunds

## Real-World Application

- Create a group activity where students test payment scenarios
- Practice webhook handling
- Test error cases
- Implement logging

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll dive into notification system. Get ready to build the notification service! 🔔
