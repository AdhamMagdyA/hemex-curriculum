# Level 3: E-commerce Full Project

## Overview
This level guides students through building a complete e-commerce application, applying all previously learned concepts in a real-world scenario.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Level 2
- Strong understanding of Node.js
- Experience with databases and APIs

## Level Objectives
By the end of this level, students will:
- Build a full e-commerce platform
- Implement advanced backend features
- Handle complex business logic
- Deploy and maintain the application

# Teaching steps (to be converted int lessons):

## ðŸ“š 1: Understanding Client Needs
When working with clients you will need to understand what they need for their project. Interviewing them will help you understand their needs, and based on that we can create the user stories to help us list the features we need for each user of the system.

here is an example of user stories:

### ðŸ‘¥ User Stories

#### Authentication & User Management
1. As a customer, I want to register with email/OTP so I can access my account securely
2. As a user, I want to log in with JWT tokens so I can access protected endpoints
3. As an admin, I want to create users an assign them roles so I can restrict sensitive operations
4. As a user, I want to update my profile so I can keep my information current

#### Product Catalog
5. As a customer, I want to browse products so I can shop and buy them  
6. As a customer, I want to filter by category/price so I can find relevant items
7. As an admin, I want to CRUD product operations so I can manage inventory

#### Cart & Orders
9. As a customer, I want a persistent cart so I can save items for later  
10. As a customer, I want to checkout idempotently so I avoid duplicate charges
11. As an admin, I want to view all orders so I can manage fulfillment

#### Payments
13. As a customer, I want to have the option to pay online

#### Notifications
15. As a customer, I want order confirmation emails so I have purchase records
16. As an admin, I want payment failure alerts so I can follow up promptly

then we can translate the user stories into real features in our app:
See the [project README](../resources/projects/ecommerce/README.md) for full feature details.

## ðŸ“š 2: Building the ERD
Based on the features build the ERD step by step with students
[View the database schema](../../../resources/projects/ecommerce/docs/schema.dbml)
![Database Schema Diagram](../../../resources/projects/ecommerce/docs/ecommerce_subdb.png)

## ðŸ“š 3: Building the schema as Prisma shcema
setup the project structure of the nodejs app and add the prisma schema

### Prisma Schema

1. **Initialize Prisma**:
   ```bash
   npm install prisma @prisma/client
   npx prisma init
   ```

2. **Configure Database Connection**:
   Edit `.env` with your database URL:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/db_name"
   ```

3. **Define Models**:
   Add models to `prisma/schema.prisma` based on your ERD
   (Example: User, Product, Order models with relations)

4. **Generate Client**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. **First Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

6. **Apply to Production**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

explain the difference between production and dev migrate
(explain migrations in general)

7. **View Data**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

Key Points:
- Always run `prisma generate` after schema changes
- Use `migrate dev` for development, `migrate deploy` for production
- The schema.prisma file is the single source of truth for your database structure

## ðŸ“š 4: Building the Auth Functionalities

1. **login and registration**
use jwt to generate tokens

2. **add password encryption using bcrypt**

3. **add API validation with joi**

4. **add email verification**
- prepare the verify-email endpoint that will be used to verify the user's email
- prepare an email service to send verification emails
- complete flow of sending emails that direct user to the verify-email
- don't forget to go through the email configurations (.env variables)

5. **add password reset**
- using speakeasy to generate OTP
- prepare the request-password-reset endpoint that will be used to request a password reset
- prepare the verify-reset-otp endpoint that will be used to verify the OTP
- prepare the reset-password endpoint that will be used to reset the password based on the resetVerified, resetVerifiedExpiry

**Challenge**: add a rate limiter to limit the OTP requests

6. **add user profile management**
7. **add user CRUD for admin to manage**
