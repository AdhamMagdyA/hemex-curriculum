# Dockerizing the Application: The Digital Container üê≥

## Lesson Overview

Welcome to the deployment phase! In this lesson, we'll containerize our application using Docker. Think of it as creating a digital container ship that can transport our application anywhere üê≥.

## For Instructors

### Lesson Objectives

Students will learn:
- Docker concepts and terminology
- Containerize Node.js app
- Containerize database
- Deploy to cloud platform

### Teaching Strategy

- Use the "container ship" analogy
- Start with basic Docker concepts
- Add containerization gradually
- Use practical examples
- Emphasize deployment best practices

## Part 1: Docker Concepts - The Digital Shipping Yard üöÄ

### Key Concepts

1. **Docker Terms**
   - Images
   - Containers
   - Volumes
   - Networks

2. **Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM node:18-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

## Part 2: Application Container - The Digital Cargo Container üì¶

### Key Features

1. **Node.js Container**
   - Set up environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure ports
   - Set up volumes

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```dockerfile
   ENV NODE_ENV=production
   ENV PORT=3000
   ENV DATABASE_URL=...
   ```

## Part 3: Database Container - The Digital Storage Container üì¶

### Key Features

1. **Database Container**
   - Set up MySQL
   - Configure volumes
   - Set up environment
   - Create network

2. **Docker Compose**
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=production
     db:
       image: mysql:8.0
       volumes:
         - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
       environment:
         - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=...
   volumes:
     db_data:
   ```

## Part 4: Cloud Deployment - The Digital Port üèùÔ∏è

### Key Steps

1. **Cloud Setup**
   - Create GCP/AWS account
   - Set up credentials
   - Configure firewall

2. **Container Registry**
   - Push images
   - Configure access
   - Set up CI/CD

### Best Practices

- Always use multi-stage builds
- Keep containers small
- Use volumes for persistence
- Implement proper networking

## Real-World Application

- Create a group activity where students test containerization
- Practice cloud deployment
- Test scalability
- Implement monitoring
